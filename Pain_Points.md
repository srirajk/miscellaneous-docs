## **Complete Revised Pain Points Table (Final):**

| **Pain Point** | **What we change** | **End state** | **Measured Outcome (KPI)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Infrastructure overhead** - AI engineers spend weeks provisioning AWS services, setting up auth, configuring environments | Standardized kickstarters with infrastructure pre-configured and ready to deploy | AI engineers focus on AI development, not infrastructure setup | **% reduction in setup time** OR **Time to first working solution** |
| **Ambiguity in getting started** - No clear path from zero to working AI solution - unclear what to use, how to start, which patterns to follow | Sequential blueprint approach: Prerequisites → RAG → MCP → Agent → Multi-Agent with clear documentation | Well-defined journey with standardized patterns reduces decision fatigue | **Time to first agent deployed** OR **# of engineers onboarded successfully** |
| **Lack of standardized AI patterns** - Every team building AI solutions differently with inconsistent approaches | Blueprints provide standardized patterns for common use cases with best practices baked in | Consistent, repeatable AI development across organization | **# of teams using standard blueprints** OR **% of projects following standard patterns** |
| **Fragmented AI template management** - Templates scattered across teams with no central discovery or sharing mechanism | Hub-managed template repository with crowdsourced contributions from AI engineering community | Central catalog of vetted, reusable AI accelerators | **# of templates contributed** OR **# of template downloads** |
| **Platform capability validation gaps** - CAI AI COE team needs safe environment to evaluate emerging platforms (Nvidia NeMo, Databricks, Vertex AI Agent Builder, Azure AI Studio) | Playground Account for Platform Hub team to test, validate, and create consumption guides | Platform team thoroughly evaluates technologies before organizational rollout | **# of platform capabilities validated** OR **Time from tech release to blueprint** |
| **Production deployment gaps** - Prototypes work but lack observability, governance, and cost controls for production | Blueprints include Arize AI monitoring, governance hooks, and cost tracking from day one | Production-ready solutions from the start, not retrofitted later | **% of AI projects reaching production** OR **Time to production deployment** |
